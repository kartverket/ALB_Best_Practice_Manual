# Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry - Best Practice Manual
<div style="text-align: right"> Ver 2025.01 </div>

## Introduction
This manual provides comprehensive guidelines on the use of Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) in Norway. The intended audience is organizations procuring ALB and its content is based on the report "Validation and application of Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) technology for improved management and monitoring of Norwegian rivers and lakes : a pilot study 2021-2022" carried out by Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), The Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket), The Norwegian Environment Agency (Miljødirektoratet), The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen), and Hafslund Eco Vannkraft.

# Measurement Concept and Sensors
Detailed explanations of ALB technology principles, operational techniques, and sensor specifics used in bathymetric data collection.

# ALB Pros and Cons
An overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry compared to traditional surveying methods.

# ALB Use Cases in Norway
Descriptions and examples of practical applications and projects utilizing ALB technology within Norway.

# ALB Procurement Process
Guidelines and recommendations on procuring ALB services, including tendering, specifications, and evaluation criteria.

# ALB Project Workflow
Step-by-step guide through the lifecycle of an ALB project, from planning and execution to data analysis and dissemination.

# Example Specifications
Sample technical specifications and quality requirements for ALB projects.

# Quality Control 
A quality control check of the delivered dataset should be performed as soon as possible to identify deficiencies in the raw dataset as well as errors in the delivery format, report, and metadata. A minimum QC regime based on QGIS and PDAL can be found [here](/qc/ALB_QC_Steps.md).

# Glossary
**ALB (Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry)**  
A remote sensing technology using aircraft-mounted LiDAR sensors to measure seafloor and underwater terrain in shallow coastal and inland waters.

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**  
A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the Earth.

**LAS/LAZ (LAS/LAZ file format)**  
File format designed for the interchange and archiving of lidar point cloud data. LAZ is a lossless compressed version.
